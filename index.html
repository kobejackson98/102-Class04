                            <p>Hey, my name is Kobe J. Jackson, I'm 24 years old and I am currently Software Engineer student at CodeCrew in Memphis Tn!

                            To go a little bit more in detail about myself, and my coding journey, I actually started learning code on Code Academy a couple of years back, and always enjoyed the process of creating something. I come from a family who has a history in construction, and I feel I am doing the exact same thing, but digitally! I am currently learning Markdown, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am looking forward to see what this road holds ahead </p>
